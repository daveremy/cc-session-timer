# cc-session-timer

**Experimental script** that shows the remaining time in your current Claude Code 5-hour session. Perfect for tmux status bars or quick command-line checks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

This is an **unofficial tool** that reads from local JSONL log files to calculate session times. Since Anthropic doesn't provide an official API for session information, this script:

- May not perfectly match Claude's internal session tracking
- Could break if Claude Code changes its logging format
- Shows calculated time based on activity timestamps

## üôè Inspiration & Credit

This tool was inspired by the excellent [ccusage](https://github.com/zckly/ccusage) project, which provides comprehensive Claude Code usage analytics. We studied ccusage's session calculation logic to ensure our timer matches their implementation. If you need detailed usage analytics, token counts, and cost tracking, check out ccusage!

## How It Works

Claude Code uses 5-hour rolling sessions that:
- Start at the floored hour of first activity (e.g., activity at 11:23 AM ‚Üí session starts at 11:00 AM)
- End exactly 5 hours later (e.g., 11:00 AM ‚Üí 4:00 PM)
- A new session starts if >5 hours have passed since the session start OR >5 hours since the last activity

This tool reads timestamp data from `~/.claude/projects/*/` JSONL files to calculate when your current session will end.

## Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveremy/cc-session-timer/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/daveremy/cc-session-timer.git
cd cc-session-timer

# Make the script executable
chmod +x cc-session-timer

# Copy to your PATH
cp cc-session-timer ~/.local/bin/
# Or use sudo for system-wide installation
sudo cp cc-session-timer /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage

```bash
# Default: tmux-friendly format
cc-session-timer
# Output: ‚è≤Ô∏è 2h30m

# Verbose: human-readable format
cc-session-timer verbose
# Output: Session: 11:00 AM - 4:00 PM
#         Session ends at 4:00 PM (2h30m left)

# Raw: seconds remaining (for scripting)
cc-session-timer raw
# Output: 9000

# Debug: verbose with debug information
cc-session-timer debug
```

## tmux Integration

Add to your tmux status bar for always-visible session monitoring:

```bash
# In your ~/.tmux.conf
set -g status-right '#[fg=yellow]#(cc-session-timer) #[default]| %H:%M %d-%b-%y'
```

The script uses different emoji indicators based on time remaining:
- ‚è≤Ô∏è More than 1 hour remaining
- ‚è±Ô∏è Less than 1 hour remaining
- ‚è∞ Less than 15 minutes remaining (warning!)

## Why Use This?

While [ccusage](https://github.com/zckly/ccusage) provides comprehensive analytics with `npx ccusage@latest blocks --live`, this tool is designed for:

- **Lightweight monitoring** - Just bash, no Node.js required
- **tmux integration** - Always visible in your status bar
- **Quick checks** - Instant session time without analytics overhead
- **Scripting** - Simple output formats for automation

## Requirements

- Bash 4.0+
- macOS or Linux
- Claude Code installed with activity in `~/.claude/projects/`

## Limitations

- Only shows current session when in a Claude project directory
- Requires Claude Code activity to have generated JSONL files
- Session calculation is best-effort based on observed patterns
